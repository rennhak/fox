Dear pomodoro fellows,

I also use the pomodoro technique, and appreciated and used the nice
programs posted in this group.

A couple of problems remain though, not addressed by these programs:

1. I like to hear the pomodoro ticking, but unfortunately most
programs limit themselves to the final ringing.

2. Sometimes I don't need a computer or laptop to work, yet I use the
pomodoro.

Also, when sharing an office with others or working in a public place,
I can't allow the ticking and ringing to disturb those around me.

The solution to these problems is simple: have the ticking and ringing
as mp3 files - they can be played on a computer/laptop or on an mp3-
player; and if you use a headset the ticking and ringing won't disturb
anybody.

So I recorded a real pomodoro ticking and ringing. The mp3s, a 25-min
pomodoro and a 5-min one, can be found here:

I hope other pomodoro friends may find them useful.

Cordially,
Luca

PS: On a computer it is particularly convenient to 'play' them in
Winamp with 'classic' skin, because the latter can be reduced to a
very thin window that does not occupy great part of the screen, and
can even count-down the song duration, thus acting as a timer.
